# Cybersecurity Tools: DuckyScript Password Stealer (Educational)

## üö® Warning: Educational Purposes Only
This repository contains a DuckyScript code used for educational purposes to demonstrate how attackers can potentially steal passwords from Chrome browsers on Windows 10. It is intended for security researchers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity students to learn more about cybersecurity practices.

**DO NOT use this script for malicious purposes.** Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Windows 10 machine
- [DigiKeyboard](https://github.com/matrixes/DigiKeyboard) library to emulate keystrokes (for use with Arduino or other USB devices)
- Chrome browser installed
- PowerShell for email sending configuration

## üí° How It Works
This script emulates keystrokes on a target machine and performs the following actions:
1. Opens Chrome browser via Windows + R command and types the URL for saved passwords.
2. Navigates through Chrome's password settings.
3. Extracts password data and saves it to a CSV file.
4. Sends the CSV file via email using PowerShell and Gmail's SMTP server.

## üìù Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Upload the script to an Arduino or similar device capable of sending keystrokes.
3. Execute the script on a machine running Windows 10 with Chrome installed.
4. Ensure you have enabled "Less secure app access" on your Gmail account: [Link to Google Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps).
5. The script will retrieve Chrome passwords and email them to the predefined recipient.
